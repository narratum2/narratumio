# The Ultimate Guide to Luxury Nail Salons in Lisbon

Finding a nail salon you can trust in a new city isn't easy. Between hygiene standards, nail health, and artistic skill, there's a lot to consider. We've spent months vetting Lisbon's nail salons to bring you this comprehensive guide.

## Why Nail Care Matters in Lisbon

Lisbon's climateâ€”warm, humid summers and mild wintersâ€”affects your nails more than you might think. The calcium-rich water can make nails brittle, while the Atlantic breeze and cobblestone streets put extra stress on manicures and pedicures.

**Key considerations:**
- **Hygiene:** Look for autoclaved tools, disposable files, and clean workstations
- **Products:** High-quality polishes (OPI, Essie, CND) last longer in Lisbon's climate
- **Technique:** Proper cuticle care prevents infection in humid weather
- **Nail Health:** Professionals who prioritize nail strength over aesthetics
