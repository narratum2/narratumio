## 🧪 FINAL VERIFICATION NEEDED

I cannot view browsers, so you must test these:

### Test 1: Symbol Popups
1. Scroll to "Strategic Frequencies"
2. Click "Strategy" (first circle)
3. **Expected:** Content expands below symbol
4. **Console should show:** `[DEBUG] Symbol clicked: 0 strategy` and more details

### Test 2: Navigation  
1. Right dots visible and sticky? ✅ (you showed working)
2. Top menu appears after scroll and stays? (test this)

### Test 3: Footer
1. Click "Privacy" in footer
2. **Expected:** Modal appears as overlay (not inline)
3. **Console should show:** `[MODALS] Modal opened successfully`
