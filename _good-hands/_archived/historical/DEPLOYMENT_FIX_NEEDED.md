# 🔧 Deployment Issue & Current Status

**Last Updated:** January 11, 2025  
**Status:** Site is LIVE but recent commits have build errors

---

## ✅ WORKING SITE (Currently Live)

**Live URL:** https://good-hands-3erz7v15f-narratums-projects.vercel.app  
**Commit:** `d219149` - From 2 hours ago  
**Status:** ✅ Fully functional

**What's Working:**
- All pages load
- Navigation works
- Services page (basic version)
- Booking form
- Premium pages
- Mobile responsive

---

## ❌ Recent Deployment Errors

**Problem:** Last 3 commits are failing to build on Vercel

**Failed Commits:**
1. `e97836c` - TypeScript error fixes (still has issues)
2. `dda2684` - Added missing dependencies
3. `ace5adc` - Status documentation

**Root Cause:**
The Stripe and Notion API integrations have TypeScript compatibility issues with the current Next.js 13.5.6 version.

---

## 🛠️ SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option 1: Remove Problematic Files (Quick Fix)
Temporarily remove the new API routes causing build errors:
- `/app/api/stripe/*` 
- `/lib/notion.ts` (or comment out problematic code)

**Pros:** Immediate deployment fix  
**Cons:** Lose Stripe/Notion integration (add back later)

### Option 2: Upgrade Next.js (Better Long-term)
Upgrade to Next.js 14+ which has better TypeScript support

**Pros:** Modern features, better compatibility  
**Cons:** Requires Node 18.17+, might need other adjustments

### Option 3: Fix TypeScript Strict Mode
Adjust tsconfig.json to be less strict for now

**Pros:** Keep all features  
**Cons:** Not ideal for production code quality

---

## 📋 RECOMMENDED ACTION

**For now:** Use the working deployment (`d219149`)

**Next steps:**
1. Continue building features on top of working commit
2. Create Stripe/Notion integration in separate branch
3. Test locally before deploying
4. Or: Keep working and fix deployment later (features more important)

---

## 🚀 CURRENT WORKING FEATURES

Everything from Sprint 1 that was working:
- ✅ Homepage with hero
- ✅ Services page  
- ✅ Booking form (submits to API)
- ✅ All neighborhood pages
- ✅ Premium pages (weddings, retreats, corporate)
- ✅ About page
- ✅ Journal/blog structure
- ✅ Guides preview
- ✅ Full navigation
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ SEO optimized

**Missing from live (but coded):**
- Membership page
- Search function improvements
- Stripe checkout
- Notion integration

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Keep working on features!** The site is live and functional. I can:

1. Continue building content (blog articles, guides, FAQs)
2. Enhance existing pages
3. Add more premium pages
4. Create better documentation
5. Fix deployment in parallel

The membership/Stripe stuff can be added later when you actually set up Stripe. For now, let's focus on making the live site AMAZING with content and features that don't require external APIs.

---

**What do you want me to prioritize?**

A. Fix deployment first (might take time debugging)
B. Continue adding features/content (site is already live)  
C. Both (work on content, fix deploy in background)

I recommend **C** - let me keep improving the site while the working version stays live! 🚀
