## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Stripe Fees:
```
Scenario 1: €105 booking (European card)
Fee: €105 × 1.5% + €0.25 = €1.83
You receive: €103.17

Scenario 2: €105 booking with €15 discount
Customer pays: €90
Fee: €90 × 1.5% + €0.25 = €1.60
You receive: €88.40

Scenario 3: €49/month VIP membership
Fee: €49 × 1.5% + €0.25 = €0.99/month
You receive: €48.01/month
```

**Monthly Cost Estimate (50 bookings):**
- Average booking: €105
- Total processed: €5,250
- Stripe fees: ~€82
- Effective rate: 1.56%

**This is MUCH cheaper than:**
- PayPal: ~€152/month
