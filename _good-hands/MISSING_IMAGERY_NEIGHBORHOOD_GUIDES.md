## üìã Problem

Neighborhood guide pages need **contextually appropriate imagery** that matches each area's character and description. Currently using generic beauty service images that don't represent the neighborhoods.

### Current State
Each neighborhood is using random brand images:
- **Chiado** ‚Üí hero-salon-interior.png (generic salon)
- **Pr√≠ncipe Real** ‚Üí category-hair-styling.png (hair styling)
- **Baixa** ‚Üí blog-lisbon-guide.png (generic Lisbon)
- **Avenida** ‚Üí salon-detail.png (salon detail)
- **Alfama** ‚Üí beauty-moment.png (beauty moment)
- **Bel√©m** ‚Üí category-wellness.png (wellness)
- **Sintra** ‚Üí experience-wellness-retreat.png (retreat)
- **Cascais** ‚Üí category-skincare.png (skincare)

Using best available brand images as placeholders while maintaining site functionality.

**Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Reduces contextual relevance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weakens neighborhood differentiation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't fully convey area character
- ‚úÖ Maintains brand consistency and quality
- ‚úÖ Site remains functional

```
