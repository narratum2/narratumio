## Maintenance Guidelines

### Red Flags to Watch:
🚨 Sounds like a press release → Rewrite  
🚨 Wouldn't say it to a friend → Rewrite  
🚨 Has 5+ bullet points → Make narrative  
🚨 Every sentence starts with "We" → Vary structure  
🚨 Uses "leverage" or "synergy" → Delete immediately  
🚨 Says "embark on a journey" → Start over  
🚨 Promises to "unlock potential" → Be specific  
🚨 Uses "cutting-edge" (unless actual scissors) → Simplify  

### Quality Checks for New Content:
✅ Read it out loud - Does it sound natural?  
✅ Friend test - Would you text this to a friend?  
✅ Specificity test - Any real names or examples?  
✅ "So what?" test - Why should the reader care?  
✅ Fluff test - Can you cut 20% without losing meaning?  
✅ Jargon test - Any corporate buzzwords?  
✅ Voice test - Does it sound like the same person wrote it?
