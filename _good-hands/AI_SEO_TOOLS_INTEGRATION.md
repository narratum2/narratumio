**What We Already Have:**
‚úÖ BeautySalon schema

**What to ADD:**
```javascript
// 1. LocalBusiness with GeoCoordinates (enhanced)
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BeautySalon",
  "name": "Good Hands",
  "description": "Premium beauty concierge service in Lisbon",

### 4. **OpenAI Actions Schema** (ChatGPT Integration) ü§ñ
**Purpose:** Make your site directly queryable by ChatGPT  
**Cost:** FREE  
**Why Critical:** ChatGPT is the most used AI assistant

**Implementation:**
We need to create an **OpenAPI 3.0 spec** that ChatGPT can use to interact with your site.

**File:** `/public/openapi.json` (we already started this!)

**Enhance it with:**
```json

          "200": {
            "description": "Availability status"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
