# Content Polish Summary — October 12, 2025

## What We Did

Conducted a comprehensive content review and polish of the Good Hands website, removing AI-generated patterns and typical marketing speak. Made the writing more personal, conversational, and inspired by high-end design-driven brands like Design Hotels.

"Lisbon has incredible talent. Finding it shouldn't take hours of research, crossed fingers, and hoping for the best. We know who's actually good, and we're here to make introductions."

---

## Brand Voice Now

**Good Hands sounds like:**
- That friend who knows everyone in the city
- Someone who's done the research so you don't have to
- A person who gives honest recommendations
- An insider sharing knowledge, not selling something

**Good Hands doesn't sound like:**
- A corporate brochure
- A desperate salesperson
- An AI chatbot
- A generic marketplace

---

## Design Inspiration Applied

From **Design Hotels** we learned:
1. Don't oversell - describe, let reader decide
2. Use white space - not every inch needs words
3. Tell stories - not features and benefits lists
4. Trust the reader - assume sophistication
5. Be specific - names, places, real details
6. Short sentences. Period.

Applied throughout all updated content.

## How to Use These Changes

### For Future Content:
1. Read CONTENT_WRITING_GUIDELINES.md first
2. Write first draft quickly
3. Read out loud
4. Remove bullet points where possible
5. Cut corporate jargon
6. Add specific examples
7. Use "so what?" test
8. Get second opinion

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- If it sounds like a press release → rewrite
- If you wouldn't say it to a friend → rewrite
- If it has 5+ bullet points → make narrative
- If every sentence starts with "We" → vary structure
- If it uses "leverage" or "synergy" → delete and start over

## Success Criteria

**Good content should:**
- Sound like a knowledgeable friend
- Use specific examples and names

**Our content now:**
- ✅ Sounds human, not AI-generated

## Quote from the Work

> "The best writing doesn't feel like writing. It feels like someone smart, who knows what they're talking about, giving you straight advice. That's who we are. Write like that."
