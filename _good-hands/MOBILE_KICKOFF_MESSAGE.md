Subject: 🚀 Mobile UI/UX Implementation - Let's Get Started!

Hi Team! 👋

We've completed a comprehensive mobile UI/UX audit of Good Hands and identified 25 improvements that will significantly enhance our mobile experience and conversions.

📊 THE OPPORTUNITY:
• Investment: €4,800 (100 hours over 4 weeks)
• Expected Return: €21,600 in 6 months (350% ROI)
• Mobile conversions: +15-20% increase
• Form completion: 45% → 65%
• Touch accessibility: 88% → 100%

🎯 TOP 3 CRITICAL ISSUES:

2. Hero sections too tall on small phones
3. Booking form too long (15+ fields causing abandonment)

⚡ QUICK WIN: 17 Minutes of Work = 7% Improvement
We can fix 4 issues in 17 minutes that will immediately improve touch target compliance from 88% to 95%.
