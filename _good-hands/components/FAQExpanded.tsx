      {
        q: 'What is Good Hands?',
        a: 'We connect you with the best beauty professionals in Lisbon. Hair, nails, skin, makeup, wellness. Every person in our network has been tested by us personally. No trial and error. No disappointments. Just people who are genuinely good at what they do.'
      },
      {
        q: 'How does it work?',
        a: 'Tell us what you need. We match you with the right person. We handle the booking. You show up. That\'s it. We confirm everything within 24 hours.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Why not just book directly?',
        a: 'Because three hours of Instagram scrolling and contradictory reviews is exhausting. We\'ve already done that work. Everyone in our network has been tested personally. No guessing. No hoping for the best. Just someone who knows what they\'re doing.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you work with AI assistants like ChatGPT or Claude?',
        a: 'Yes! AI assistants can query our services through our public API. If ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or other AI assistants recommend beauty services in Lisbon, they can access our real-time service information, pricing, and availability to help you make the best choice.'

  {
    category: 'Booking & Pricing',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How much does it cost?',
        a: 'Hair starts at €105. Nails at €65. Skincare at €95. Makeup at €85. Wellness at €80. That includes the service and our concierge fee. No hidden costs. What you see is what you pay.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Is the concierge fee worth it?',
        a: 'One bad haircut costs €60 plus the stress of fixing it. One disappointing facial is €80 you\'ll never get back. We eliminate that risk. Most people tell us we paid for ourselves after the first booking.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I book same-day appointments?',
        a: 'Sometimes, yes! While we typically confirm within 24 hours, we can often accommodate same-day requests depending on availability. Contact us as early as possible, and we\'ll do our best to make it happen.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What if I need to cancel or reschedule?',
        a: 'We understand plans change. Cancel or reschedule at least 24 hours before your appointment, and there\'s no fee. Within 24 hours, cancellation policies vary by professional. Gold and Platinum members get free cancellations anytime.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you accept vouchers or gift cards?',
        a: 'Yes! Good Hands gift cards make perfect presents. We also honor promotional codes and membership discounts. Platinum members get 25% off, Gold members get 15% off all services.'
      }

  },
  {
    category: 'Service Quality',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How do you vet professionals?',
        a: 'Rigorously. We personally visit every salon, review certifications, check hygiene standards, test services, read customer feedback, and conduct interviews. Only about 1 in 5 professionals we evaluate make it onto our platform. We prioritize skill, cleanliness, communication, and professionalism.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What if something goes wrong?',
        a: 'Tell us. We follow up after every appointment. If it wasn\'t right, we fix it. Different professional, complimentary redo, or refund. Your call.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do professionals speak English?',
        a: 'Yes. Every professional in our network is English-speaking or has staff who speak English fluently. Clear communication is one of our vetting criteria. If language is a concern, let us know and we\'ll match you accordingly.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Can you accommodate special requests?',
        a: 'Absolutely. Allergies? Sensitivities? Specific techniques? Vegan products only? Let us know in your booking request. We match you with professionals who can accommodate your needs.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Neighborhoods & Locations',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'Which Lisbon neighborhoods do you cover?',
        a: 'We serve all major Lisbon neighborhoods: Chiado, Príncipe Real, Alfama, Baixa, Avenida da Liberdade, Belém, and beyond. We also cover Cascais and Sintra. Tell us where you are or where you\'d like to go, and we\'ll find the perfect match nearby.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Can professionals come to my hotel or home?',
        a: 'Yes, for certain services. Makeup artists and some hair stylists offer mobile services. This is especially popular for weddings, events, or hotel guests. Mention this in your booking request.'
      },
      {
        q: 'I\'m staying in Cascais—do you serve that area?',
        a: 'Yes! Cascais is one of our key areas. We work with excellent beach-area professionals who understand the coastal lifestyle and resort aesthetic.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Memberships',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'What are the membership benefits?',
        a: 'Gold Members (€49/month) get 15% off all services, priority booking, exclusive events, and free cancellations. Platinum Members (€99/month) get 25% off, first access to new professionals, quarterly beauty consultations, and VIP concierge support. Both tiers pay for themselves in 2-3 bookings per month.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I cancel my membership anytime?',
        a: 'Yes, absolutely. No contracts, no penalties. Cancel anytime through your member portal. You\'ll keep benefits until the end of your billing cycle.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Is membership worth it if I only book once a month?',
        a: 'Yes, if you\'re booking services over €200/month. Example: One hair appointment (€105) with Gold membership saves €16. Add a manicure (€65) and you save another €10. That\'s €26 saved vs. €49 membership—you break even quickly and get priority access and free cancellations as bonuses.'
      }

  },
  {
    category: 'Specific Services',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'I need a hairstylist for my wedding in Sintra. Can you help?',
        a: 'Yes! Weddings are our specialty. We match brides with experienced bridal stylists who travel to Sintra venues. We coordinate trials, day-of timing, bridal party services, and backup plans. Book 3-6 months in advance for best availability.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you offer corporate wellness services?',
        a: 'Yes. We work with companies to provide on-site or nearby beauty and wellness services for employees. Perfect for corporate retreats, team events, or ongoing wellness programs. Contact us for group pricing.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I book a full beauty day package?',
        a: 'Absolutely! Many clients book multiple services in one day—hair, nails, facial, massage. We coordinate timing and locations to create a seamless spa day experience. Popular for pre-wedding prep, birthdays, or just self-care.'
      },
      {
        q: 'I have very curly hair. Do you have specialists?',
        a: 'Yes. We specifically match you with curl specialists who understand curly, coily, and textured hair. This is one of the most common requests, and we have excellent professionals trained in curl-specific techniques and products.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'For Visitors & Expats',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'I\'m visiting Lisbon for a week. Is Good Hands for me?',
        a: 'Yes! Many of our clients are visitors. We help tourists avoid the stress of finding quality services in an unfamiliar city. Book before you arrive, and we\'ll have everything confirmed by the time you land.'
      },
      {
        q: 'I just moved to Lisbon. How does Good Hands help expats?',
        a: 'We\'re your instant beauty network. Moving to a new city means starting from zero—no trusted hairstylist, no go-to nail salon. We solve that immediately. Many expats become members because we eliminate months of trial-and-error.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you help with Portuguese beauty customs?',
        a: 'Yes. Portuguese beauty culture has nuances—tipping customs, communication styles, booking etiquette. We brief you on everything and handle communication in Portuguese when needed. Consider us your cultural bridge.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Technical & AI',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How do I book through ChatGPT or other AI assistants?',
        a: 'If an AI assistant like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity recommends Good Hands, they can access our services information through our public API. They\'ll direct you to our website or provide booking details. You can complete your booking on our site or through the AI assistant\'s recommendation.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Is my data safe?',
        a: 'Yes. We use industry-standard encryption, secure databases, and comply with GDPR regulations. We never sell your data. Your booking information is only shared with the specific professional you\'re matched with.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you have an app?',
        a: 'Our website is mobile-optimized and works beautifully on all devices. A dedicated app is coming in 2026. For now, bookmark goodhands.com on your phone for quick access.'
