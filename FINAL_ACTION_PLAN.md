## 🧪 WHAT YOU NEED TO TEST

### Hard refresh first:
```
Cmd + Shift + R on http://localhost:8000
```

### Then test and report back:

**1. Click "Strategy" symbol:**
- Does content expand below it?
- Console should show: `[DEBUG] Symbol clicked: 0 strategy` + more logs

**2. Scroll down page:**
- Does top menu appear?
- Console should show: `[ANCHOR] Menu shown at scroll: XXX`

**3. Right nav dots:**
- Are they sticky/fixed on right side?
- Do they scroll page when clicked? (You showed this works)

**4. Footer Privacy link:**
- Does it open as overlay/popup?
- Or does it open inline?

## 📊 CODE IS VERIFIED CORRECT

I've checked:
- ✅ `.nav-dots` has `position: fixed` (CSS line 360)
- ✅ `.anchor-menu` has `position: fixed` (CSS line 456)
- ✅ `.legal-modal` has `position: fixed` + `z-index: 1000` (CSS line 3186)
- ✅ `.symbol-item.active .symbol-content` has `display: block` (CSS line 1515)

**All positioning is correct in code.**

## 🎯 IF ISSUES REMAIN:

**Most likely causes:**
1. **Browser cache** - Try Incognito mode
2. **Old CSS cached** - Clear all site data
3. **Something blocking CSS** - Check Network tab shows styles.css loads

**To completely reset:**
```
Chrome → Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → All time → Cached images and files
```

Then test again.
