## üèÜ COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION

### What Makes Us Different:

**Not a Marketplace**  
We don't list everyone. We curate the best. Only 1 in 5 professionals we evaluate make it onto our platform.

**Not Passive Tech**  
AI enables us, but humans make every match. A real person reviews every booking and follows up personally.

**Not Commission-Driven**  
Our fee is transparent and included upfront. We recommend based on fit, not who pays us more.

**Not Scalable at Quality's Expense**  
We could add 1,000 salons tomorrow. We won't. Growth is secondary to maintaining standards.

4. **Social Proof** (white bg): Reviews, stats, testimonials
5. **Details/Features** (alternate bg): Deep dive
6. **FAQ** (shell bg): Address objections
7. **CTA** (ink/dark bg): Clear next action

### Every Page Needs:

---

## üéØ FINAL PRINCIPLES

**Quality Over Speed**  
Better to have 10 perfect pages than 50 mediocre ones.

**Specificity Over Scale**  
"Hair colorists in Chiado who specialize in balayage" beats "beauty services in Lisbon."

**Truth Over Marketing**  
If we can't deliver it, we don't claim it. Honesty builds trust faster than hyperbole.

**Customer Benefit Over Feature List**  
"Skip months of trial-and-error" beats "We have 500 professionals."

**Local Over Generic**  
Every page should feel unmistakably Lisbon. If it could work in any city, rewrite it.

**This document governs all content and design decisions. When in doubt, return to these principles.**
