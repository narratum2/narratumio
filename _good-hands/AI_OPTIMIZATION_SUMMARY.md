## 🎨 Design System Quick Access

### Most Used Patterns

**Colors:**
```tsx
bg-porcelain text-ink        // Standard page
bg-ink text-porcelain        // Dark sections
text-gold                    // CTAs
focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gold // Focus states
```

**Spacing:**
```tsx
py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-32     // Section padding
mb-6                         // Headline margin
p-8                          // Card padding
gap-6                        // Grid gap
```

**Typography:**
```tsx
font-serif text-5xl font-bold      // H1
font-serif text-4xl font-semibold  // H2
font-sans text-base                // Body
```

**Components:**
```tsx
className="btn-primary"      // Primary button
className="btn-secondary"    // Secondary button
className="input-field"      // Form input
```
