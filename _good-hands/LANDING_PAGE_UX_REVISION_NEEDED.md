- No neighborhood/location filter

**Needed:**
- Add neighborhood dropdown

- OR: Remove search entirely, use quick action cards instead

- User said design is incorrect

## üéØ RECOMMENDED UX/UI REVISION PLAN

### Phase 1: Search Section (URGENT)

**Option A: Fix & Enhance Search**
```typescript
<SearchBar>
  - Free text input (for service names)
  - Category dropdown (Hair, Nails, etc.)
  - Neighborhood dropdown (Chiado, Alfama, etc.) ‚Üê ADD THIS
  - Better placeholder: "Try: balayage, facial, massage..."
  - Search button with proper styling
</SearchBar>
```

**Option B: Replace with Quick Actions (RECOMMENDED)**
```typescript
<QuickActions>
  Browse by Service Category (5 cards)
  Browse by Neighborhood (8 cards)
  Browse by Experience Type (3 cards)
  - Much clearer UX
  - Visual, not text-based
  - Matches boutique aesthetic
</QuickActions>
```

**Option C: Simplified Search**
```typescript
<SimplifiedSearch>
  Just 2 dropdowns:
  - What do you need? (Service category)
  - Where? (Neighborhood)
  - "Find Services" button
  - No free text input
</SimplifiedSearch>
```
