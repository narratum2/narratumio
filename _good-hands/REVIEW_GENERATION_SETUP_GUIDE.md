# üìù Review Generation Setup Guide
## Building Social Proof for AI Discovery

**Purpose:** Generate 20+ authentic 5-star reviews across platforms to build authority signals for AI agents

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

## üéØ WHY REVIEWS MATTER FOR AI

AI agents (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) heavily weight:
- **Review quantity:** More reviews = more trusted
- **Review quality:** Average rating (target: 4.8+)
- **Review platforms:** Multiple platforms = more legitimate
- **Review recency:** Recent reviews signal active business

**Goal:** 50+ reviews with 4.9+ average across platforms by Month 2
