## Writing Philosophy

Write like you're texting a smart friend who asked for a recommendation. Not a marketing brochure. Not a corporate presentation. Just honest, direct, useful information from someone who actually knows.

---

## What We Avoid

### ‚ùå Typical AI Patterns

**Don't write:**
- "We're thrilled to announce..."
- "Embark on a journey of..."
- "Discover the transformative power of..."
- "Unlock your full potential..."
- "Experience unparalleled luxury..."

**Instead:**
- Just say what it is
- Use active voice
- Get to the point
- Skip the superlatives

### ‚ùå Too Many Dashes and Bullet Points

**Don't:**
```
Our Services:
- Premium hair styling
- Expert color matching
- Professional consultation
- Personalized experience
- Quality guarantee
```

**Instead:**
Tell a story. Use full sentences. Connect ideas.

```
We know the best colorists in Lisbon. People who trained in Paris or London and actually know what they're doing. Book with us and we'll match you with someone who gets what you're looking for.
```

### ‚ùå Corporate Speak

**Avoid:**
- "Leverage"
- "Synergy"
- "Best-in-class"
- "World-class"
- "Cutting-edge" (unless talking about actual scissors)
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changing"
- "State-of-the-art"

**Use instead:**
- Simple, clear words
- "Good" is fine. "Really good" works too.
- "The best" only if you mean it

### ‚ùå Excessive Enthusiasm

**Don't:**
"We're SO excited to help you find your PERFECT match! Our AMAZING team can't WAIT to connect you with INCREDIBLE professionals!"

**Do:**
"We know everyone worth knowing. Tell us what you need."

---

## What We Do Instead

### ‚úÖ Write Like You Talk

**Good examples:**

"Finding a good hairstylist in a new city is awful. You spend hours scrolling Instagram, reading contradictory reviews, hoping you don't end up with a disaster. We've already done that work. Every stylist in our network, we've tested personally."

"Pr√≠ncipe Real is where Lisbon keeps its interesting people. Artists, designers, people who dress well. The neighborhood wraps around a garden with a massive old cedar tree."

"It won't go wrong. But if it does, we handle it. No forms, no runaround."

### ‚úÖ Be Specific

**Vague:**
"Our professionals are highly trained and experienced."

**Specific:**
"Ricardo trained in Paris and specializes in curly hair. Ana has the gentlest touch for facials. Sofia knows color."

### ‚úÖ Use Short Sentences

Break up long, flowing sentences. Use periods. Let ideas breathe.

**Not this:**
"We believe that finding the right beauty professional should be an accessible and transparent process, which is why we've created a comprehensive vetting system that ensures every professional in our network meets our rigorous standards for quality and expertise."

**This:**
"Finding someone good shouldn't be hard. We test everyone before they join our network. Most don't make it. The ones who do are genuinely excellent at what they do."

### ‚úÖ Show, Don't Tell

**Telling:**
"We provide white-glove concierge service with personalized attention to detail."

**Showing:**
"We handle booking, directions, translations, confirmations, reminders. All the coordination that usually eats up your afternoon. You tell us when and what you want. We arrange it. You show up."

### ‚úÖ Write for Humans, Not Search Engines

Yes, SEO matters. But write for real people first.

**Bad (keyword stuffing):**
"Looking for Lisbon beauty services? Our Lisbon beauty concierge connects you with premium Lisbon beauty professionals for luxury beauty services in Lisbon."

**Good:**
"We connect you with the best beauty professionals in Lisbon. Hair, skin, nails, makeup, wellness. Whatever you need, we know the right person."

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Confident, Not Arrogant

**Arrogant:**
"We're the only service you'll ever need."

**Confident:**
"We know who's good. We'll introduce you."

### Personal, Not Casual

**Too casual:**
"Hey girl! Let's get you glammed up! üíÖ‚ú®"

**Personal:**
"Tell us what you're looking for and we'll match you with someone who actually gets it."

### Helpful, Not Pushy

**Pushy:**
"Book now! Limited slots available! Don't miss out!"

**Helpful:**
"Ready to book? Tell us what you want. We'll handle the rest."

---

## Specific Style Rules

### Headlines
- **Short.** 5-8 words max.
- **Clear.** Say what the section is about.
- **No puns.** Unless they're really good.

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "What We Actually Do"
- ‚úÖ "How It Works"
- ‚úÖ "Services We Book"
- ‚ùå "Beauty Begins Here"
- ‚ùå "Your Journey to Perfection"
- ‚ùå "Unlock Your Inner Glow"

### Body Copy
- **18-25 words per sentence** (average)
- **3-5 sentences per paragraph**
- **Use contractions.** Write how you talk.
- **Address the reader as "you"**

### Calls to Action
- **Action-oriented**
- **Specific**
- **No "Learn More"**

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Book Your First Service"
- ‚úÖ "Make a Booking"
- ‚úÖ "Tell Us What You Need"
- ‚ùå "Get Started"
- ‚ùå "Learn More"
- ‚ùå "Discover Our Services"

## Writing Process

### 1. Write First Draft
Write fast. Get ideas down. Don't edit yet.

### 2. Cut Everything Unnecessary
Delete:
- Adverbs (very, really, quite, extremely)
- Qualifiers (perhaps, maybe, possibly)
- Redundancies ("free gift", "advance planning")
- Corporate jargon
- Empty phrases

### 3. Read Out Loud
If it sounds awkward when you read it aloud, rewrite it.

### 4. Use the "So What?" Test
For every sentence, ask: "So what? Why does the reader care?"

If you can't answer, delete it or rewrite it.

### 5. Get Someone Else to Read It
Fresh eyes catch things you miss.

## Design Hotels Inspiration

What we learned from Design Hotels:

1. **They don't oversell.** They describe. You decide.
2. **They use white space.** Not every inch needs words.
3. **They tell stories.** Not features and benefits.
4. **They trust the reader.** No hand-holding.
5. **They're specific.** Names, places, details.
6. **They assume sophistication.** Their audience is smart.

Apply these principles to everything we write.

## Common Mistakes to Fix

### Mistake: Using "We" Too Much
**Before:** "We offer premium services. We work with vetted professionals. We handle all booking."

**After:** "Every professional is vetted. Every booking is handled. You just show up."

### Mistake: Explaining Too Much
**Before:** "Our concierge service means that we take care of all the coordination, booking, confirmation, and communication with the professional on your behalf, so you don't have to worry about any of the details."

**After:** "We handle the coordination. You show up."

### Mistake: Being Vague About Value
**Before:** "We provide exceptional value through our comprehensive service offerings."

**After:** "Book through us and you get access to professionals who don't take walk-ins. Plus someone who actually answers when something goes wrong."
