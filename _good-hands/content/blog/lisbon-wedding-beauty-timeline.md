## Common Wedding Beauty Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Try new products the week before** - Risk of breakouts/reactions
2. **Over-pluck eyebrows** - They need time to grow
3. **Get aggressive facial treatments** - Redness takes time to fade
4. **Skip makeup trial** - Photos can look different than mirror
5. **Forget about photos** - What looks good in person might photograph differently
6. **Neglect your neck & chest** - Match makeup to dress
7. **Go too bold or too nude** - Find balance for photos
8. **Rush the morning** - Start early, allow buffer time

### ✅ DO:
1. **Bring reference photos** - But trust your team's expertise
2. **Test everything thoroughly** - Including in different lighting
3. **Communicate clearly** - About style, comfort, concerns
4. **Plan for touch-ups** - Someone should hold emergency kit
5. **Stay hydrated** - Best beauty secret
6. **Eat breakfast** - Low blood sugar = fainting bride
7. **Assign a coordinator** - Someone to manage timeline
8. **Enjoy the process** - This is a special experience!
