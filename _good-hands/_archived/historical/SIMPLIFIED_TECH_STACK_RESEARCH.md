# üî¨ SIMPLIFIED TECH STACK - Research First Approach

**Research Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Goal:** Find existing all-in-one solutions instead of building from scratch

## ‚ùå WHAT WE WERE DOING WRONG

**Original Plan (Too Complex):**
- Notion API (manual setup)
- Make.com (build scenarios)
- Stripe (integrate manually)
- Customer.io (email)
- Intercom (chat)
- Custom membership portal
- **Result:** 6+ tools to manage, lots of custom code

**Problem:** We're reinventing the wheel! These solutions already exist.
