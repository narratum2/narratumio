If you need to reference historical documentation:

### Historical Snapshots (dated files)
**Location:** `_archived/historical/`
- Phase completion reports
- Session summaries
- Deployment snapshots
- Milestone reviews
- Research and analysis documents

### Redundant Files (duplicates)
**Location:** `_archived/redundant/`
- Duplicate status files
- Multiple summaries of same content
- Outdated indices
- Obsolete checklists

### Blog Content
**Location:** `_archived/blog-content/` or `content/blog/`
- Blog articles (should be in `content/blog/`)
- Misplaced content files

## ✅ DOCUMENTATION BEST PRACTICES

### For All Contributors:
1. **Read before writing** - Check if information already exists
2. **Update, don't duplicate** - Improve existing docs instead of creating new ones
3. **Use this index** - Always refer to DOCUMENTATION.md to find the right file
4. **Keep it current** - Update docs as you make changes
5. **Archive, don't delete** - Move outdated docs to `_archived/` with clear naming

### For AI Agents:
1. **Start with START_HERE.md** - Always begin here
2. **Check PROJECT_STATUS.md daily** - Know current state
3. **Follow team coordination** - Use INTEGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
4. **Document your work** - Update relevant files after completing tasks
