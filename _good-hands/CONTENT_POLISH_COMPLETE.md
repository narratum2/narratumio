## The Transformation

### Before: AI-Generated Style
"We believe that beauty services should be accessible to everyone. Our mission is to democratize access to premium beauty experiences through our innovative platform that connects discerning clients with vetted professionals. We leverage our extensive network to deliver unparalleled service."

### After: Personal, Conversational
"Lisbon has incredible talent. Finding it shouldn't take hours of research, crossed fingers, and hoping for the best. We know who's actually good, and we're here to make introductions."

- AI clich√©s ("embark on a journey", "unlock your potential")
- Repetitive structures ("We believe...", "We offer...")
- Excessive enthusiasm ("SO excited!", "AMAZING!")
- Generic claims without proof
- Long, winding 40+ word sentences
- "Think of us as..." AI patterns

---

## Writing Principles Applied

### From Design Hotels We Learned:
1. **Don't oversell** - Describe, let reader decide
2. **Use white space** - Not every inch needs words  
3. **Tell stories** - Not features and benefits lists
4. **Trust the reader** - Assume sophistication
5. **Be specific** - Names, places, real details
6. **Short sentences** - Use periods liberally

### Our Voice Now Sounds Like:
- A knowledgeable friend
- Someone who's done the research
- An insider sharing knowledge
- A person giving honest recommendations
- NOT a corporate brochure
- NOT a desperate salesperson
- NOT an AI chatbot
- NOT a generic marketplace

## The Bottom Line

Every edit removed fluff and added substance. Every rewrite chose clarity over cleverness. Every change made the content more human.

**Before:** Corporate brochure trying too hard  
**After:** Friend who knows everyone, sharing insider knowledge
