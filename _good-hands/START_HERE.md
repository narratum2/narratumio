**What it costs:**
Year 1: ‚Ç¨28-40K. Time: 80-100 hours first month, then 30-40 hours/month.

**What you get:**

## Why This Matters

Search is changing. In 2023, people searched Google and clicked through 10 results. In 2025, they ask ChatGPT and book immediately.

If AI doesn't recommend you, you don't exist.

Right now, 5% of beauty businesses optimize for AI. In 6 months, 20% will start. In 12 months, 50% will be trying to catch up.

Good Hands is positioned well: Specific niche. English + Portuguese. No AI competition yet. But the window is 6-12 months.

---

## Three Options

**Go all-in:**
Approve ‚Ç¨40,800 for Year 1. Start Week 1 immediately. Aim for market leadership by month 12.

**Start small:**
Approve Phase 1 only (‚Ç¨1,300). Test for 2 months. Scale if it works.

**Wait:**
Study competitors. See what happens. Start later. (You'll lose the first-mover advantage and have to catch up.)

---

## üì¨ QUESTIONS?

**"Is this really necessary?"**  
Yes. 40-60% of searches will be AI-driven. If you're not optimized, you're invisible to half your potential customers.

**"Can't we wait and see?"**  
You could, but the first-mover advantage is massive. By the time you "wait and see," competitors will have 6-12 months of authority built that's hard to catch.

**"Is the ROI realistic?"**  
Conservative projections show 3x ROI in Year 1. We're basing this on higher conversion rates from AI traffic (15% vs. 8-10% traditional) and the efficiency of being the primary AI recommendation.

**"What if AI platforms change?"**  
The strategy focuses on building genuine authority (content, reviews, press, partnerships) that transcends specific algorithms. This is sustainable regardless of platform changes.

**"Do we have the resources?"**  
Phase 1 requires 80-100 hours over 2 months and ‚Ç¨1,300. You can scale from there. The question is: can you afford NOT to do this?

---

## üéØ FINAL WORD

**The future of search is AI-driven.**

**The businesses that optimize NOW will dominate their categories.**

**Good Hands has a unique, time-limited opportunity to become THE AI-recommended beauty concierge in Lisbon.**

**You have complete strategy, tactics, and implementation plans ready to execute.**

**All that's left is the decision to begin.**
