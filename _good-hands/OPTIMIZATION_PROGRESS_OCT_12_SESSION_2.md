## Key Learnings

### What Works for Blog Content:
1. **Lead with the problem** - "You're new in Lisbon" beats "Digital nomads face challenges"
2. **Cut aggressively** - Most bullet lists can become one sentence
3. **Speak directly** - "Your neck hurts" not "neck strain may occur"
4. **Real details** - "Pr√≠ncipe Real, Cais do Sodr√©, Santos" not "trendy neighborhoods"
5. **No marketing speak** - "We handle it" not "comprehensive concierge solutions"

### What Works for Documentation:
1. **Front-load key info** - Status first, details later
2. **Scannable structure** - Short paragraphs, clear headings
3. **Remove ceremony** - "Updated" not "Last Updated By..."
4. **Cut emojis in half** - Use sparingly for navigation only
5. **Narrative over lists** - When possible, write sentences
