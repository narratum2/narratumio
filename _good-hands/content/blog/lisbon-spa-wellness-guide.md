## Types of Spa & Wellness Services {#types-of-services}

### Massage Therapy

#### Swedish Massage (€90-120 / 60 min)
The classic relaxation massage using long, flowing strokes, kneading, and circular movements. Perfect for stress relief and improving circulation. Ideal for first-time spa-goers or those wanting pure relaxation.

**Best for:** Stress relief, relaxation, improving sleep, general wellness

#### Deep Tissue Massage (€100-140 / 75 min)
Focused, intensive massage targeting muscle knots and chronic tension. Uses slower strokes and deeper pressure to reach sublayer muscles and fascia. Can be intense but highly effective for chronic pain.

**Best for:** Chronic muscle pain, sports recovery, postural issues, tension headaches

**Citation:** *According to the American Massage Therapy Association, deep tissue massage has been shown to effectively treat chronic lower back pain and reduce anxiety.*

#### Aromatherapy Massage (€95-135 / 60 min)
Swedish-style massage enhanced with essential oils chosen for therapeutic properties. Lavender for relaxation, eucalyptus for respiratory issues, citrus for energy. The aromatic element adds psychological benefits to physical relaxation.

**Best for:** Holistic relaxation, mood enhancement, combining physical and emotional wellness

#### Hot Stone Massage (€110-150 / 90 min)
Heated basalt stones placed on key points of the body, with massage incorporating the warm stones. The heat penetrates deep into muscles, releasing tension more effectively than hands alone.

**Best for:** Chronic muscle tension, poor circulation, deep relaxation, cold-sensitive individuals

#### Pregnancy Massage (€90-120 / 60 min)
Specialized massage adapted for pregnant women, focusing on back pain, leg swelling, and stress relief. Therapists trained in prenatal safety use side-lying positions and avoid certain pressure points.

**Best for:** Second and third trimester discomfort, pregnancy-related back pain, stress relief

**Note:** Always inform your therapist if you're pregnant. Many spas won't offer pregnancy massage in the first trimester.

### Holistic & Alternative Therapies

#### Reflexology (€60-90 / 45 min)
Foot massage based on the principle that specific points on the feet correspond to organs and systems throughout the body. More than a foot rub—it's a therapeutic treatment.

**Best for:** Stress reduction, improving circulation, supporting overall wellness

#### Reiki Energy Healing (€70-100 / 60 min)
Japanese energy healing technique where the practitioner channels energy through their hands, either touching or hovering over the body. Increasingly popular in Lisbon's holistic wellness community.

**Best for:** Emotional balance, stress relief, complementary to medical treatment

#### Acupuncture (€60-100 / 60 min)
Traditional Chinese medicine using fine needles inserted at specific points to balance energy flow. Several certified acupuncturists practice in Lisbon, many trained in China or specialized European programs.

**Best for:** Pain management, digestive issues, stress, insomnia, complementary wellness

### Spa Rituals & Body Treatments

#### Hammam / Turkish Bath (€45-80 / 45-60 min)
Traditional Middle Eastern bathing ritual involving steam, exfoliation, and massage. Several Lisbon spas offer authentic hammam experiences with marble heated slabs and traditional black soap scrubs.

**Best for:** Deep cleansing, exfoliation, respiratory health, cultural spa experience

#### Body Scrub & Polish (€60-95 / 45 min)
Full-body exfoliation using salt, sugar, or other natural abrasives, followed by moisturizing. Reveals smooth, glowing skin—particularly popular before beach season or special events.

**Best for:** Smooth skin, preparing for self-tanner, pre-event glow

#### Seaweed or Mud Wrap (€80-120 / 60 min)
Body wrapped in mineral-rich seaweed or therapeutic mud, then cocooned in warm blankets. The heat enhances absorption of minerals and promotes detoxification through sweating.

**Best for:** Detoxification, skin nourishment, relaxation, inch loss (temporary)

## Lisbon's Wellness Neighborhoods {#neighborhoods}

### Príncipe Real
**Vibe:** Boutique, holistic, LGBTQ+-friendly

Príncipe Real leads Lisbon's holistic wellness movement. Expect independent practitioners, yoga studios with massage therapists on staff, and wellness centers offering everything from acupuncture to sound healing. The neighborhood attracts practitioners with alternative training and holistic philosophies.

**Best for:** Aromatherapy massage, Reiki, acupuncture, unconventional treatments
**Average pricing:** Mid-range to high (€90-130/hour)

### Chiado & Baixa
**Vibe:** Traditional luxury, European spa culture

Chiado's hotel spas (like those in 5-star hotels) offer classic European spa experiences with extensive facilities: saunas, steam rooms, relaxation lounges, and sometimes rooftop pools with Tagus views. Perfect for full spa days rather than standalone treatments.

**Best for:** Couples massage, spa days with facilities, luxury pampering
**Average pricing:** High (€120-180/hour massage; day passes €80-150)

### Avenida da Liberdade
**Vibe:** International brands, medical spas

Lisbon's grand avenue houses international spa brands and medically-focused wellness centers. If you want a brand you recognize from other cities or treatments that blur the line between spa and medical (like therapeutic massage for injury recovery), this is your neighborhood.

**Best for:** Deep tissue, sports massage, recognized international brands
**Average pricing:** High (€110-160/hour)

### Belém
**Vibe:** Peaceful, less touristy, local favorite

Belém's spas near the river offer tranquil experiences away from central Lisbon's bustle. More affordable than downtown, with Portuguese-speaking locals as the primary clientele. Great for authentic, unpretentious wellness.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious quality, local atmosphere, combining with Belém sightseeing
**Average pricing:** Mid-range (€70-100/hour)

### Cascais
**Vibe:** Beachfront luxury, resort-style

Coastal town 30 minutes from Lisbon, Cascais offers beachfront spa resorts and wellness hotels. The ocean air and seaside location elevate the wellness experience. Worth the trip for a full day of beach and spa.

**Best for:** Couples retreats, full-day spa experiences, combining beach and wellness
**Average pricing:** High (€120-180/hour)

## What to Expect at Your Appointment {#what-to-expect}

### Booking Through Good Hands

When you book through Good Hands, we handle:
- **Matching:** We consider your goals, pressure preferences, and any physical issues

### Consultation (5-10 minutes)
Your therapist will ask about:
- Areas of tension or pain
- Pressure preference (light, medium, firm)

**Be honest:** This isn't the time to be polite. If you want a relaxing massage but say nothing, you might get deep tissue intensity you don't enjoy.

- Therapist will leave room while you get on table
- You'll be draped with sheets, only exposing areas being worked on

- Silent enjoyment also perfectly acceptable

### After Treatment
- Therapist leaves while you dress

- Don't rush—take time to reorient

- Increased urination (detoxification)

## Wellness Trends in Lisbon Right Now {#trends}

### 1. Sound Healing & Vibrational Therapy
Lisbon's wellness community has embraced sound baths using crystal bowls, gongs, and tuning forks. Príncipe Real studios offer regular group sessions (€25-40) or private treatments (€60-90).

### 2. Myofascial Release
Specialized technique targeting fascia (connective tissue) rather than just muscles. Gaining popularity for treating chronic pain conditions. Requires specifically trained therapists—Good Hands can connect you with certified practitioners.

### 3. CBD Massage
Massage incorporating CBD-infused oils for enhanced anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects. Legal in Portugal and increasingly offered at progressive wellness centers.

### 4. Men's Wellness Programs
Growing recognition that men benefit from regular massage and self-care. Several Lisbon spas now offer men-specific programs, including sports recovery massage and stress management packages.

**Citation:** *The International Spa Association reports that male spa visitors have increased 47% from 2015-2024, with massage therapy being the #1 requested service.*

### 5. Longer Sessions
Clients increasingly booking 90-120 minute massages rather than the traditional 60 minutes. The extra time allows full-body work without rushing, plus time for face/scalp massage many therapists otherwise skip.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

### How often should I get massage?

**For general wellness:** Monthly is ideal for maintaining benefits
**For chronic pain:** Weekly or bi-weekly until symptoms improve, then monthly maintenance
**For stress management:** Bi-weekly provides consistent relief
**For special events:** 2-3 days before (not day-of, as you may be temporarily sore)

**Citation:** *The American Massage Therapy Association recommends regular massage for cumulative health benefits, with monthly sessions providing optimal stress management and pain prevention.*

### Is it weird if I fall asleep?

No! Falling asleep during massage is common and actually indicates deep relaxation. Therapists expect it and consider it a sign they're doing their job well.

### What if I get aroused during massage?

It's a physiological response to touch and relaxation. Professional therapists are trained to handle this discreetly and without judgment. It's not a reflection on you or them.

### Should I talk during the massage?

Entirely your choice. Some people love conversation; others prefer silence. At the beginning, let your therapist know your preference: "I'd love to chat" or "I'm hoping to zone out."

### How much should I tip?

In Lisbon: 10-15% is standard for good service, up to 20% for exceptional. Unlike the U.S., tipping isn't mandatory in Portugal, but it's appreciated for personal services.

### Can I request a male or female therapist?

Absolutely. Gender preference is common and never questioned. Simply mention it when booking.

### What about hygiene?

All Good Hands partners:
- Use fresh linens for every client
- Wash hands between clients
- Maintain clean treatment rooms
- Use high-quality, hypoallergenic oils and lotions
- Follow Portuguese health and safety regulations

### Will massage help my specific condition?

Massage can help:
- Chronic back/neck pain
- Headaches and migraines
- Fibromyalgia symptoms
- Anxiety and depression
- Insomnia
- Digestive issues (abdominal massage)
- Circulation problems

However, massage isn't a replacement for medical treatment. Always consult your doctor for persistent or serious conditions.
