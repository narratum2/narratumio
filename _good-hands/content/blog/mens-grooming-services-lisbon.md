## Common Men's Grooming Questions

### "Is this stuff just for vain guys?"

No. Professional appearance directly impacts:
- Career advancement
- First impressions
- Confidence
- Health (skin cancer detection, hygiene)
- Relationship attraction

### "How do I find time for this?"

- Efficiency is key—book during lunch, before work
- Many services are 30-60 minutes
- Monthly facials replace weekly at-home efforts
- Consider it non-negotiable (like gym, meals)

### "Isn't this expensive?"

Perspective:
- €200/month = €6.60/day
- Less than daily coffee habit
- Investment in professional currency
- Preventative care costs less than correction
- Compare to car detailing, tech upgrades

### "What if people notice?"

They will—in a good way.
- People notice when you look polished
- They don't know you had a facial
- They assume you're well-organized
- Professional appearance = respect
