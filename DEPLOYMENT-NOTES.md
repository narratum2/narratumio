# Narratum Website - Deployment Notes

## ðŸ”§ Critical Configuration Required

### 1. Contact Form Setup
**URGENT**: Replace the placeholder form ID in the contact form:

In `index.html` line 526:
```html
<form id="contactForm" class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

**Action Required:**
1. Sign up at [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form
3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree form ID

### 2. Optional Assets
For enhanced social sharing, you may want to add:
- `assets/og-image.jpg` (1200x630px for social media)
- `assets/twitter-image.jpg` (1200x600px for Twitter)

Currently using favicon.svg as fallback for social images.
