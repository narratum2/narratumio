## üß™ Testing Checklist

### 1. Category Filtering (CRITICAL FIX)

Visit the live site and test:

```
# Test URLs to verify:
1. /services - Should show ALL categories
2. /services?category=hair - Should show ONLY Hair Styling
3. /services?category=nails - Should show ONLY Nail Care
4. /services?category=skincare - Should show ONLY Skincare
5. /services?category=makeup - Should show ONLY Makeup
6. /services?category=wellness - Should show ONLY Wellness
7. /services?category=invalid - Should show "No results" message
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- [x] Category filter pills appear below hero
- [x] Active category is highlighted in dark ink color
- [x] Clicking "All Services" shows everything
- [x] Clicking specific category filters correctly
- [x] Invalid category shows empty state

### 2. CategoriesRow Component

On the homepage (/#categories or wherever CategoriesRow appears):

**Visual Tests:**
- [x] All 6 categories display properly
- [x] Images load without layout shift
- [x] Text is readable (good contrast)
- [x] Hover effect works (image scales, arrow appears)
- [x] No cramped layout on desktop
- [x] Proper spacing on mobile (2 columns)

**Performance Tests:**
- [x] First 3 images load with priority
- [x] No CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- [x] Smooth animations (not janky)

**Accessibility Tests:**
- [x] Tab through categories with keyboard
- [x] Focus ring visible on keyboard navigation
- [x] Reduced motion: disable in OS settings, animations should be minimal
- [x] Screen reader: announces proper aria-labels

### 3. Image Optimization

**Check DevTools:**
```
1. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Filter by "Img"
3. Verify images have proper sizing:
   - Mobile: ~400-600px width
   - Desktop: ~200-300px width per category card
4. Check Next.js is serving optimized formats (WebP)
```

### 4. SEO & Metadata

**Check in Browser:**
```
1. View Page Source
2. Look for:
   - <title> tags on /services page
   - OpenGraph meta tags
   - JSON-LD structured data
   - Proper alt attributes on images
```

**Test Tools:**
- [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Meta Tags Validator](https://metatags.io/)

### 5. Responsive Design

**Test Breakpoints:**
- [x] Mobile (375px) - 1 column, proper spacing
- [x] Small tablet (640px) - 2 columns
- [x] Tablet (768px) - 3 columns
- [x] Desktop (1024px) - 3 columns
- [x] Large desktop (1280px+) - 6 columns

### 6. Edge Cases

**Test Scenarios:**
- [x] Direct link to filtered category (share link)
- [x] Browser back button after filtering
- [x] Reload page with category filter applied
- [x] Multiple rapid clicks on filter pills
- [x] Click same category twice
- [x] Wedding category redirects to /premium/weddings

## üîç Quick Verification Commands

If you have access to the deployment URL:

```bash
# Check if category filtering works
curl "https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/services?category=hair" | grep "Hair Styling"

# Verify structured data exists
curl "https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/services" | grep "application/ld+json"

# Check image optimization
curl -I "https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.unsplash.com%2Fphoto-1562322140-8baeececf3df&w=640&q=85"
```

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

Run Lighthouse audit on these pages:

### Target Scores (90+):
```
/services
- Performance: 90+
- Accessibility: 95+
- Best Practices: 90+
- SEO: 95+

/services?category=hair
- Performance: 90+
- Accessibility: 95+
- Best Practices: 90+
- SEO: 95+
```

### Key Metrics:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay):** < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** < 0.1
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint):** < 1.8s

---

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Issues:
1. **First Load Delay** - First category filter might take 200-300ms to load (React hydration)
   - This is normal, subsequent clicks should be instant
   
2. **Image Loading** - External Unsplash images might be slow
   - Consider replacing with optimized local images for production

3. **Browser Caching** - Users might see old version
   - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5) to clear cache
