## üéØ WHAT I CANNOT DO

I cannot:
- ‚ùå Actually view the browser
- ‚ùå See console errors
- ‚ùå Test the interactions
- ‚ùå Verify the visual appearance

**Only you can test and tell me what's not working.**

---

## üìä CODE STATUS

‚úÖ **Verified in code:**
- All CSS rules added correctly
- All JavaScript functions exist
- No syntax errors
- Initialization order corrected
- Cache busting applied

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cannot verify without browser:**
- Does browser console show errors?
- Are elements found by querySelector?
- Do event listeners actually fire?
- Does CSS actually apply?

---

## üîÑ NEXT STEP

**You must test and report back:**

1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Open Console (Cmd+Option+J)  
3. Try clicking symbols
4. Check what console says
5. Tell me the exact error messages OR what works

**Then I can fix the actual problem, not guess at it.**
