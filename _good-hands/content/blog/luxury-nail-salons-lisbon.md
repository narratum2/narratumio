# The Ultimate Guide to Luxury Nail Salons in Lisbon

Finding a nail salon you can trust in a new city isn't easy. Between hygiene standards, nail health, and artistic skill, there's a lot to consider. We've spent months vetting Lisbon's nail salons to bring you this comprehensive guide.

## Why Nail Care Matters in Lisbon

Lisbon's climate—warm, humid summers and mild winters—affects your nails more than you might think. The calcium-rich water can make nails brittle, while the Atlantic breeze and cobblestone streets put extra stress on manicures and pedicures.

**Key considerations:**
- **Hygiene:** Look for autoclaved tools, disposable files, and clean workstations
- **Products:** High-quality polishes (OPI, Essie, CND) last longer in Lisbon's climate
- **Technique:** Proper cuticle care prevents infection in humid weather
- **Nail Health:** Professionals who prioritize nail strength over aesthetics

Lisbon's climate can affect nail polish longevity:

**Gel manicures:** Last 2-3 weeks if applied correctly  
**Regular polish:** 5-7 days (humidity affects drying)

- **"Gel ou verniz normal?"** (Gel or regular polish?)
- **"Só limar, sem cortar cutículas"** (Just file, don't cut cuticles)

Most salons we work with have English-speaking staff.
