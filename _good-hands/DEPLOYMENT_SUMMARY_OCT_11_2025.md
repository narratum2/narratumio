## 📝 Known Issues / Future Improvements

### To Address:
1. **File Sizes** - Images are unoptimized PNG (1-1.5MB each)
   - **Solution:** Convert to WebP, compress
   
2. **Missing Nail Category Image** - Using salon-detail as placeholder
   - **Solution:** Generate dedicated nail category image

3. **No Image Lazy Loading** - All images load immediately
   - **Solution:** Implement Next.js lazy loading

4. **Gemini Folder** - Still contains original files with hash names
   - **Solution:** Can archive or delete after confirming deployment works
