# Good Hands - Brand Photography Prompts

This file contains ready-to-use prompts for generating all of the imagery and video required for the Good Hands website. Each prompt is designed to produce assets that share the same colour palette, lighting and editorial mood—so you can simply copy and paste them into your chosen AI tool and expect consistent results.

## Colour & Style Guidelines

All images and videos should adhere to the following overarching style:

**Palette**: neutral, muted tones with accents of porcelain off-white (#f8f6f3), sage green (#a8b5a5), warm taupe and touches of gold (#d4af37). Avoid bright, saturated colours.

**Lighting**: soft, natural daylight (golden hour or overcast); no harsh shadows or coloured lighting. Warm undertones are preferred.

**Composition**: use shallow depth-of-field to gently blur backgrounds. Apply the rule of thirds and leave negative space for text overlays. Keep camera angles natural (eye-level or slightly above).

**Mood**: candid, relaxed and effortlessly sophisticated. Subjects appear genuinely engaged and comfortable. Props and backgrounds are minimal and complement the palette.

**Finish**: high resolution (4K for video) with a matte look and subtle contrast. No heavy filters or dramatic edits.

## Prompts by Section

### Homepage Hero

**Hero Video (Video Tool)**
Generate a seamless 4K video loop for the Good Hands homepage. The scene is inside a minimalist Lisbon beauty salon with white-washed walls and sage-green arches. Afternoon sunlight streams softly through large windows, casting gentle shadows. A stylist in neutral attire chats and laughs with a client while brushing her shoulder-length hair. Use a shallow depth of field so the background fades slightly, and keep the colour palette to porcelain, sage and warm taupe with subtle gold accents. The camera slowly tracks from behind the client around to the side, capturing candid smiles and the relaxed vibe. Match the Good Hands aesthetic in lighting and mood.

**Hero Still**
Create a high-resolution photograph that captures the same salon setting as the hero video: a bright space with white walls and sage arches, filled with soft natural light. A stylist gently styles a client's hair, both smiling naturally. Composition should leave negative space on one side for overlaying a headline. Colours stay neutral—porcelain, sage, taupe and a hint of gold—with a shallow depth of field to blur the background. The mood is candid and luxurious.

### Service Cards

**Premium Hair Styling**
Photograph a candid moment in a minimalist hair studio. A stylist with neutral clothing uses a wooden or gold-accented brush to style a client's wavy hair. Natural daylight pours in from a window, bathing the scene in soft warmth. The background is uncluttered with hints of sage-coloured décor. The shot is a mid-level close-up, focusing on the hands and hair, with the client and stylist smiling gently. Follow the Good Hands colour palette and maintain shallow depth of field.

**Luxury Nail Care**
Generate an overhead still life of a manicure in progress. Two well-groomed hands rest on a marble surface while a manicurist applies nude polish with a slim gold brush. Surround the scene with sage-coloured linen, eucalyptus sprigs and a porcelain bowl containing manicure tools. Lighting is soft and natural, with a warm tone. Keep composition clean and centred, leaving some space around the hands. Colours must remain muted and harmonious with the Good Hands palette.

**Advanced Skincare**
Create an editorial photograph of a facial treatment. A client lies back on a porcelain-coloured spa bed with a plush white towel wrapped around their head. A therapist in sage attire applies a creamy face mask using a small brush. Include a potted plant in the blurred background to add a touch of green. Lighting is diffused and comes from the side, creating soft shadows. Use a shallow depth of field and leave negative space for text if needed.

**Professional Makeup**
Produce a close-up photo of a makeup artist applying eyeliner to a model. Focus on the eye area and the artist's hand holding a gold eyeliner brush. The background is a dark sage backdrop with a gentle gradient. Skin tones are natural, and the makeup is sophisticated and subtle. Keep the colour palette neutral and warm, and use a narrow depth of field to draw attention to the detail work.

### Category Thumbnails

For each of the following categories, generate a cohesive square image. Ensure all shots share the same lighting, colour palette and composition style:

**Hair**
A stylist's hands gently tousling a client's loose waves in a bright salon with sage accents. Neutral clothing and natural light dominate the scene. The focus is on hair texture and movement.

**Nails**
Top-down view of a single elegant hand with a fresh nude manicure resting on a sage linen cloth, accompanied by a gold nail file and a small bouquet of dried flowers. Soft daylight enhances the textures.

**Skincare**
A serene still of a bowl of creamy facial mask, a wooden brush and folded white towels on a porcelain tray. A sprig of rosemary adds a touch of green. The scene is shot in natural light with muted colours.

**Makeup**
A close-up of a curated set of makeup brushes and a compact on a marble surface. One brush has a hint of rose powder on its bristles. The colour palette is neutral with subtle gold details. Soft light and shallow depth of field create a luxurious feel.

**Wellness**
An overhead shot of a sage-green yoga mat, a rolled white towel, and a ceramic cup of herbal tea with steam rising. Include a small crystal or essential oil bottle. Natural light casts gentle shadows.

**Weddings**
Capture a tender moment of a bridal bouquet resting on a rustic wooden chair in a softly lit room. The bouquet features muted florals in white, blush and sage. Leave space on one side for text overlay.

### Premium Experiences

**Bridal Beauty Journey**
Photograph a bride sitting by a window as a stylist adjusts her hair or veil. The room is filled with natural light and decorated in neutral tones. The bride holds a bouquet with sage and blush blooms. The atmosphere is intimate and calm, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the bride and stylist's hands.

**Wellness Retreat**
Create a relaxing scene of a multi-day wellness retreat. Show a cosy setup with a sage yoga mat, a stack of folded towels, herbal tea, and a small tray of skincare products on a wooden bench. Soft morning light illuminates the arrangement. Colours remain warm and muted with Portuguese coastal vibes.

**Corporate Wellness**
Capture a modern office lounge where a small group participates in a meditation or chair-massage session. Furniture is sleek and neutral with sage and gold accents. Natural light filters through floor-to-ceiling windows. The focus is on the participants' relaxed postures and the serene environment.

### Journal Article Thumbnails

Each article should feature its own unique, editorial-quality image:

**Portuguese Beauty Rituals**
Photograph traditional Portuguese beauty ingredients laid out on a ceramic platter: olive oil, sea salt, rosemary sprigs and a handmade soap. The setup sits on a linen cloth with sage accents. Lighting is natural and warm, and the composition leaves room for a title overlay.

**Wedding Beauty Timeline**
Produce a soft, romantic image of a wedding day preparation table. Include a bridal bouquet, a vintage perfume bottle, pearl earrings and a handwritten note. Use neutral tones with a hint of blush and sage. Light should be gentle and directional.

**Lisbon City Guide**
Capture a candid street scene in Lisbon's Chiado district: pastel buildings with wrought-iron balconies, a cobblestone street, and a stylish couple walking hand-in-hand. The image should feel lively yet elegant, with warm sunlight and muted colours.

### Decorative Mosaic

For the three large decorative images near the bottom of the page, use any of the following prompts to maintain variety while matching the overall aesthetic:

**Salon Interior Detail**
An angled shot of a minimalist salon corner with a single styling chair, a round mirror and a small vase of greenery. White walls and sage-green accents dominate. Natural light streams in from the side.

**Beauty Moment**
Close-up of a client's hands gently touching her freshly styled hair while smiling. The background is blurred, showing hints of a modern salon. Colours remain neutral and warm.

**Curated Product Display**
Arrange three premium beauty products (serum, hair oil and candle) on a marble slab. Surround with dried flowers and a sage linen cloth. Shot from a slight angle with soft, even daylight highlighting textures.
