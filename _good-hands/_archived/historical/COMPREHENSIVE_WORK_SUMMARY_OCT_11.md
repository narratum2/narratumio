## üí¨ QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. **Brand Identity:** Does `BRAND_IDENTITY_CORE.md` capture your vision? Any tweaks?

2. **About Page:** Once deployed, does the new About page feel right? Too much? Too little?

3. **Priority:** Should I start with:
   - Service pages (Hair, Nails, etc.)?
   - Neighborhood pages (Chiado, Pr√≠ncipe Real, etc.)?
   - Or work through phases 1-7 sequentially?

4. **Images:** For now, should I:
   - Curate best Lisbon-specific Unsplash images?
   - Source Portuguese stock photography?
   - Leave placeholders for future professional shoot?

5. **Professional Profiles:** Should I:
   - Create realistic fictional profiles for now?
   - Leave as "Featured Professional" placeholders?
   - Wait until you have real professionals to feature?
