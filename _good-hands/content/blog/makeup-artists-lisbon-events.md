## Lisbon-Specific Considerations

### Climate Challenges

**Summer (June-September):**
- **Temperature:** Often 30Â°C+ (86Â°F+)
- **Humidity:** 60-80%
- **Challenge:** Makeup melting, oil breakthrough
- **Solution:** Primer, setting powder, setting spray (triple set!)

**What to request:**
- Waterproof and long-wear products
- Mattifying primers for oily zones
- Setting spray (Urban Decay All Nighter, MAC Fix+)
- Minimal powder (cake risk in heat)

**Winter (December-February):**
- **Temperature:** Mild but rainy
- **Humidity:** High (70-85%)
- **Challenge:** Dewy makeup can look too oily
- **Solution:** Balanced finish, moisture without shine

**What to request:**
- Hydrating base (but not too dewy)
- Light coverage (skin can look good year-round)
- Cream products that don't dry out
- Water-resistant mascara (rain!)

### Portuguese Beauty Aesthetic

Traditional Portuguese makeup tends toward:
- **Natural, glowing skin** (not matte)
- **Defined eyes** with mascara
- **Soft lips** in berry or nude tones
- **Bronzed warmth** (not contoured)
- **Minimal vs. "Instagram" makeup**

**International influence:**
Modern Lisbon artists can do any style, but understanding the local aesthetic helps communicate your vision.

### Language & Communication

**English fluency:**
- Most professional makeup artists speak English (especially those working with international clients)
- Fashion and bridal specialists almost always speak English
- Everyday makeup artists may have limited English

**Pro tip:** Show reference photos! Visual communication transcends language.

## Insider Tips

### 1. Show References, Not Just Descriptions
Don't say "natural but glowy"â€”show 3-5 photos of exactly what you want. Pinterest and Instagram are your friends.

### 2. Be Honest About Your Comfort Level
If you rarely wear makeup, say so! A good artist will adjust their approach.

### 3. Book Morning Appointments When Possible
Artists are freshest, lighting is best for photos, and you have time for adjustments.

### 4. Skip Heavy Meals Before Makeup
Flushed face from eating can affect color matching and blending.

### 5. Come With Clean, Moisturized Skin
Makeup applies better on prepped skin. Use your regular skincare 30-60 minutes before.

### 6. Speak Up During Application
If something feels off, say so! Good artists welcome feedback.

### 7. Request a Touch-Up Kit
Ask what products they're using so you can touch up later (lipstick, powder).

### 8. Take Photos in Natural Light
Makeup looks different in various lighting. Check in daylight before finalizing.
